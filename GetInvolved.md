# How do I help? #

As the ARIS project matures, I believe it's success will be determined by the quality and diversity of it's contributors.

If you think this project is cool we could really use your help! Here are some specific ways:

## Development ##
  1. If you haven't already done so, [Checkout](http://code.google.com/p/arisgames/source/checkout) the source code.
  1. The editor and iPhone client can be run against our development server for development. The server will obviously  need to be [installed](http://arisgames.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/INSTALL) on your own box.
  1. Goto the [Editor Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/90924)  or  [Client/Server Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/29384), pick an item from the current or Backlog queue and do it!
  1. Since this is open source, the other option is to do whatever the heck you want and share it back if it generalizes in any way.
  1. Once you have something that you want to share back with the repository, email the aris developer group with a patch. A great guide to making patches is at [Ten Minute Guide to diff and patch](http://stephenjungels.com/jungels.net/articles/diff-patch-ten-minutes.html). After a few of these we will get you commit access to the svn repo.

## Document ##
Help document the code that already exists by adding javaDoc code directly in the source files or editing these wiki pages

## Design ##
Do you have some ideas on how the interface could be improved? Draw them up and share them with us. We always need new storyboard ideas!

## Collect ##
ARIS authors need a growing collection of stock media to get them started. If you have skills in photoshop, iMove, Audacity, etc we could use your help to collect stock images for items (320x416), npcs (320x416), icons (30x30), video (480x320 h264) and audio (mp3).

## Testing ##
If you offer to beta test releases, I'll email you with testing copies of new releases for feedback.



# Management Philosophy #

Since ARIS is an authoring tool we have not only end users, but game designers to serve. As all developers know, it is easy to spend a lot of time on things that matter very little.

If we are going to be successful we need to be listening to the designers. So the first step was to establish an easy way for them to post their ideas and vote the most wanted fixes and features to the top.

This list is at [ARIS Bug Reports and Feature Requests](http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=36451&t=36451.41&f=36451.a2bf1)

This list will be reviewed and the most timely and feasible items are moved to the queues for the [Editor](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/90924) and the [Client/Server](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/29384) on pivotal tracker. For now, I'm the main person doing this but I hope that at some point we will have a better management strategy.

Criteria I'm using:

  * Does the feature/bug report help a live, right now project?
  * Is it interesting?
  * Is it critical?
  * Will it benefit a large number of people?
